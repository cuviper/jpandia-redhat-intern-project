Copr Builder And Automater

These scripts allow users to automatically create copr builds and search previous builds for abnormal test failures. Abnormal test 
failures are tests that failed on some architectures (processecers like s390x, aarch64 etc.) but passed on others.

In order to connect to the copr API, you must the API token in the ~/.config/copr directory. For clear instructions: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/api/
